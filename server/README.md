This directory contains artefacts from the MCP tutorial for server developers: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server (19 April 2025)

MCP servers can provide three main types of capabilities:
- Resources: File-like data that can be read by clients (like API responses or file contents)
- Tools: Functions that can be called by the LLM (with user approval)
- Prompts: Pre-written templates that help users accomplish specific tasks

The tutorial primarily focuses on tools.
